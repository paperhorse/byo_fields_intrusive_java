Intrusive data structures in java
=================================

Intrusive data structures have their linking pointers embedded in their data nodes. They are how you naturally do you data structures if you hand write your algorithms in C. Libraries almost always use non-intrusive data structures where the node's have only link pointers plus another pointer to the data object.
